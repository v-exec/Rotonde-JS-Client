# Rotonde Web Client

The _Rotonde Web Client_ is a javascript client that fetches self-hosted JSON files containing profiles and posts, and compiles them into a feed.

Was built prior to Rotonde's migration to P2P browser: [Beaker](https://github.com/beakerbrowser/beaker). As a result, this client is deprecated.
