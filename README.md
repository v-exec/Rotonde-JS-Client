# Rotonde Web Client

The _Rotonde Web Client_ is a javascript client that fetches self-hosted JSON files containing profiles and posts, and compiles them into a feed.

A running instance of my Rotonde feed is available at http://rotonde.v-os.ca/feed.
My personal profile information is available at http://rotonde.v-os.ca.

### Installation

1. Download this repo.
2. Host the downloaded files somewhere.
3. Modify the `feed.json` file according to the [Rotonde standards](https://github.com/Rotonde/Specs). 
4. You're done! Enjoy Rotonde at your hosted location /feed.
